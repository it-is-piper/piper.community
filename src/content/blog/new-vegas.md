Fallout New Vegas's _Honest Hearts_ DLC is set entirely within Utah's Zion National Park, which I've never been to. And yet, it somehow speaks so completely to my experience of growing up in Yakima, Washington that I keep searching for art to replace it and coming up empty.

## disclaimer

_Disclaimer: Honest Hearts constructs several fictional tribes (the White Legs, Sorrows, and Dead Horses) that traffic heavily in Native American stereotypes (both in their visual presentation and accents). While the individual characters are humanized, I don't think it comes off as a particularly thoughtful portrayal. One could argue that this representation is justified by it's function as satire of white missionary colonialism; I'm not sure it totally succeds there. This post isn't explicitly about said portrayal, but I still feel obligated to mention it, especially as a white person growing up on ceded but colonized Yakama land (see the [Treaty with the Yakama 1855 (Cession 364)](https://native-land.ca/maps/treaties/cession-364) for more info)._

## part 1: the view

_Honest Hearts_ starts with an ambush by some White Legs tribespeople, but shortly after the players meets Follows-Chalk, their first companion for the DLC. He's a Dead Horses member who hews closely to the ["Native Guide"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NativeGuide) trope (though he gets his own story later). Companions grant the player unique perks in Fallout: New Vegas, and Follows-Chalk's [Well-Stacked Cairns](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Well-Stacked_Cairns) reveals nearby locations on the map when you reach a vista (like a fire tower on a peak). Seeing the reveal text for the perk brought a lot of feelings. I love it when games find ways to express their narrative through game mechanics, but this did something even cooler: it translated my childhood experience of wonder when reaching a mountain top on a hike into a visual that also had narrative wait.
